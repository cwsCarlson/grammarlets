# Grammarlets
This is a Java-based project I created in high school for the [2017 Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/2017-winners/), which won in Florida's 7th District.

The program is a self-tutoring program for grammar-related tests such as the SAT Writing section, in which users must select incorrect text in a passage, type the correct version of the text, and select the original error (e.g. a run-on sentence). The user's answers are automatically graded upon submission.

This project was coded in [Greenfoot 3.5.0](https://www.greenfoot.org/door) and was inspired by Amruth Kumar's [Problets](http://www.problets.org/) software.

The files included are from the second version of this program; the only differences from the first are more detailed comments and the fixing of one minor bug. (This bug prevented text from being selected if the brace was dragged backward.) Also included is a "Big" version of this application, which doubles the resolution of the window.

Note that the .jar files included will not work on any version of the JRE past Version 8. In addition, note that these files were not uploaded until well after the competition concluded.
