Inspired by "Problets" by Amruth Kumar (http://www.problets.org/)

==Instructions==
Open Grammarlets.jar to begin. Make sure the Java Runtime Environment is installed from https://java.com/en/download/.

Read the passage and look for grammar errors. If you see one, click and drag the mouse cursor from left to right over the word(s) in question to select them. Make sure to cover the whole word, as failing to do so means it will not be selected. If you are trying to correct a punctuation mark, select the words on both sides of it.

Releasing the mouse button will select text and open a new Answer Input window. Type in what you think is the correct answer and select why you think the original incarnation of the text was incorrect from the menu.

Upon clicking "Submit," you will recieve feedback on your responses. The original text will be covered by a line, and the correction and reasoning you chose will be above it. If any of these are colored red, then that means that specific component of your answer was incorrect. Otherwise, they will be colored green.

To erase your last answer, click the "Undo" button in the lower right.

To submit your answer, click the "Submit" button in the lower right. (If you have not provided any answers, this will be presented as "Don't Know".) This will inform you what corrections you missed or answered incorrectly, along with the correct replacement and reasoning. If this was the last question, the tutor will close.

==Editing Answer Keys==
To edit the answer key, you will need to install 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/.

Right-click on Grammarlets.jar. Point to 7-Zip in the menu and click "Open Archive". Locate "QuestionList.txt" and double-click to edit. When you are done, click "OK" on the dialog box to update the file.

==Writing Answer Keys==
Each question MUST be written in this format. Make sure everything is on the same line.

::[1]%%[2a]&&[2b]&&[2c]##[3a]&&[3b]&&[3c]

1. The full question text. This is the text before any corrections are made.
2a. A block of text to be corrected.
2b. What the user should correct 2b to.
2c. The error number for 2a (see below).
3a. Another block of text to correct.
3b. What 3a is corrected to.
3c. The error number for 3a (see below).
You can add up to 10 corrections. Due to limited space, test your text out before using it.

For example:
::They is a happy coupled.%%is&&are&11##%%coupled&&couple&&4::I love me sister he loves me too.%%me&&my&&13##sister&&sister;&&5##he&&she&&8
