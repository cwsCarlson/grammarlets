::DMNs' new show "The Man and the Wolf" is certainly the best show in the entirety of Friday-night 8:00 PM television. Unfortunately, due to the incredibly low standards for Friday-night 8:00 PM television I still dont think I'd call it good.%%DMNs'&&DMN's&&7##television I&&television, I&&5##dont&&don't&&5::The show has two problems, firstly, the show's writing tends to prize plot over character, but almost every plot in the show is too dependent on the characters.
